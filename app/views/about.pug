              h2 Welcome!

              p We're a volunteer organization, here to help you and your friends become community activists.

              p The U.S. election of November 8, 2016 was a terrible event. This is our response.

            .col-xs-12.col-lg-6.square
              p Our intention is to make a serious effort to address the challenges of our time &ndash; the top three being climate change, institutionalized "out-grouping" (racism, sexism, and all), and labor exploitation.

              p The Morning Shift Coalition will serve as a bridge between organizations &ndash; such as the ACLU and 350.org &ndash; and volunteers, and will provide an answer to the question: 

          .about-content.row
            .col-xs-12.rect
              h2 &ldquo;What can I do to help?&rdquo;

              p Every member comes to the coalition with a different set of priorities, and we understand that. We will be matching each member's intentions with 1-3 specific actions, weighted by their interests, who they trust, and their available time.

              p Our actions will address both urgent situations, to prevent further damage to our country, and long-term goals, to build a prosperous society. We will operate in this manner at the local, regional, and national level.

              p Our actions will include the political, the apolitical, personal reflection, and group collaboration.

              h2 Today

              p We do our work in the morning, before attending to our day jobs. We do this because it puts our priorities first, and it ensures steady progress in our efforts.

              p On Fridays, we look for projects, organizations, and causes that are making an important impact on our communities, and we make contributions, big and small, to the #FridayFund. 

              p More is on the way. Every morning.

              p.outro We look forward to working with you. If you are interested in volunteering, or have further questions, please contact us through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/morningshiftcoalition/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiftMorning">Twitter</a>.
